#### Philosophy

The DMAIC procedure can be regarded as an application of optimization in industry or organization. 

### Terminology

- **Define:** We first should define a response variable Y, which is related to our goal. As we need to define **cost function** in optization, we should define **defect** in DMAIC. Therefore, our **project objective** is to reduce the defect to a significant degree (usually 70%, so called 6 $\sigma)$.
- **Baseline:** Usually, the average of Y of currently collected data.
- **Goal:** Y of future data after **control**.
- **Baseline defect:** The defect (a cost function) of baseline.
- **Goal defect:** The defect (a cost function) of goal.
- **Improvement:** $Improvement \frac{Baseline defect - Goal defect}{Baseline defect}$. Usually set as 70%.
