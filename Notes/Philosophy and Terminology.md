#### Philosophy

The DMAIC procedure can be regarded as an application of optimization in industry or organization. 

- **Define:** We first should define a response variable Y, which is related to our goal. As we need to define **cost function** in optization, we should define **defect** in DMAIC. Therefore, our **project objective** is to reduce the defect to a significant degree (usually 70%, so called 6$\sigma$).
