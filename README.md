### Case Study: 

#### Problem Statement

Data from January throughout April, 2016, from First P2P, reflects an average 1.0370% five-day incrase rate of trading volume of the platform (ranges from 0.5714% to 1.6497%). Based on the financial professinal knowledge, operation condition of the company, and the financial market environment, it is believed that a five-day increase rate is normaly distributed, and a value that less than 0.83% is regarded as a defective value (currently, around 15% defective values). The incfluence factors are basicly from four aspects: financial products factors, platform capital factors, price of fund factors, and alternative financial products factors. 

#### Project Objective

Increase the five-day increase rate of the trading volume from 1.04% to the 1.10% by the end of the second quarter (June 30, 2016), therefore the proportion of defective values drop from 15% to 8.6% (71% improvement).
