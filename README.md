# DMAIC

#### Introduction to DMAIC

DMAIC is a structured problem-solving methology widely used in business. The letters are an acronym for the five phases of Six Sigma improvement: **Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control**. These phases lead a team logically from defining a problem through implemening solutios linked to underlying causes, and establishing best practices to make sure the solutions stay in place.

### Case Study: 

#### Problem Statement

Data from January throughout April, 2016, from First P2P, reflects an *average 1.0370%* five-day incrase rate of trading volume of the platform with around *15% defiftive values*. Based on the financial professinal knowledge, operation condition of the company, and the financial market environment, it is believed that a five-day increase rate is normaly distributed with constant variance, and a value that *less than 0.83% (assumed to be constant in our project)* is regarded as a defective value, which can lead to a reduction in benifit of the company.

#### Project Objective

Increase the five-day increase rate of the trading volume from *1.04%* to the *1.10%* by the end of the second quarter (June 30, 2016); therefore the proportion of defective values drop from *15%* to *9%* (*67%* improvement), given the normality with constant variance assumption.
