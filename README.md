# DMAIC for Trading Volume of Internet Finance Company in China

#### DMAIC

DMAIC is a structured problem-solving methology widely used in business. The letters are an acronym for the five phases of Six Sigma improvement: **Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control**. These phases lead a team logically from defining a problem through implemening solutios linked to underlying causes, and establishing best practices to make sure the solutions stay in place.

#### Project Statement

Trading volume reflects the status of operation of the P2P company objectively. This problem happens on each workday in a three-month period started from January 1, 2016. Considering the issue of confidential policy, we can only collect the data of 3 months. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that we are at the end of the date that the data is collected to do the project. Our project is based on observational data, so we can hardly get a cause-and-effect conclusion. Beside, as the data only covers three months, we cannot find solution considering seasonal variation.
