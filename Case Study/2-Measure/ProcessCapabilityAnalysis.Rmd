#### Process Capability Analysis

```{r message=F}
setwd("/Users/ewenwang/Dropbox/Data Science/DMAIC/Case Study/3-Analyze")

require(dplyr)

df = data.frame(read.csv("data.csv", header = T)[-c(1:4),-1])

lsl = 0.2
usl = NA
target = 1.10

require(qcc) # Quality Control Charts

ir5d <- qcc.groups(df$Increase.Rate.5Day, rep(1, length(df$Increase.Rate.5Day)))
object = qcc(ir5d, type = "xbar", plot = F)
process.capability(object, spec.limits = c(lsl, usl), target = target)
```

The Cp_l is 1.404, with a confidence interval (1.208, 1.6), which indicates that the process is capable.
