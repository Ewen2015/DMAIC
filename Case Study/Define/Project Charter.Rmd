#### Problem Statement:

The increase rate of trading volume reflects the status of operation of a internet finance company objectively. Our project started from January 1, 2016 to Jube 30, 2016 (the first two quaters in 2016). The data are colocted since the begining of the project to today (April 20) expect weekends, and all the data are colected from the database of the company. According the experience of the operation executive officer of the company, the distribution of increase rath of trading volume can be regarded as normality; and a rate of 3% should be a baseline. A defect can be difined as a increase rate that is lower than -10%.

#### Project Objective:

Increase the increase rate of the trading volume from 3% to the 5% by the end of the second quarter.
