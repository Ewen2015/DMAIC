|1. Rate of Return |1. LB Received |1. Balance |1. R.007 |
|2. Term |2. LB Used |2. Capital Inflow | |
|3. TZD Account| | | |

#### Regression Analysis

```{r}
setwd("/Users/ewenwang/Dropbox/Data Science/DMAIC/Case Study/3-Analyze")

df = data.frame(read.csv("data.csv", header = T)[-c(1:4),-c(1, 2, 3)])
attach(df)
require(caret)
require(leaps)

trans = preProcess(df, c("BoxCox", "center", "scale"))
predictorsTrans = data.frame(trans = predict(trans, df))

model = regsubsets(Increase.Rate.5Day ~., data = df)
summary(model)

```
