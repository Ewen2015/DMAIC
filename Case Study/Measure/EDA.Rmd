#### Input the data

```{r}
setwd("/Users/ewenwang/Dropbox/Data Science/DMAIC/Case Study/Measure")

df = data.frame(read.csv("data.csv", header = T)[-c(1:4),-1])
str(df)
summary(df)
```

#### Define defect and goal

```{r}
summary(df$Increase.Rate.5Day)
baseline = mean(df$Increase.Rate.5Day)
sd = sd(df$Increase.Rate.5Day)

hist(df$Increase.Rate.5Day, br = 30, freq = F)
x = seq(-0.65, 1.65, 0.01)
lines(x, dnorm(x, baseline, sd))

defect.value = quantile(df$Increase.Rate.5Day, 0.15)
baseline.defect = sum(df$Increase.Rate.5Day < defect.value)/sum(df$Increase.Rate.5Day)

goal = 1.10
goal.defect = pnorm(0.83, goal, sd)

improvement = (baseline.defect - goal.defect)/goal.defect
improvement
```
